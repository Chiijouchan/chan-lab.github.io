description: "John earned his Ph.D. working with Dr. Michael Burkart at the University of California, San Diego. His primary focus was the application of protein NMR to the carrier proteins central to fatty acid, polyketide, and non-ribosomal peptide synthetic pathways.


In the Fraser lab, he will use structural and computational techniques to explore structural biology and study minor conformational states.


John is supported by a Kirschstein NRSA (F32) fellowship from [NIH/NIAID](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/)."
